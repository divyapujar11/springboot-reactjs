what is reactJS?
* it is javaScript library used to build simple page application
* reactJS is declarative, efficient, and flexible Javascript library for building reusable UI components
* reusable UI components - reactJS is basically based on components, like tags<> in html, we reuse tags with different purpose.
* AJAX - * it is Asynchronous Javascript And Xml
	 * it is not a programming language
	 * it updates a web pages whithout reloading the page
	 * request and recieve data from server after the page has reloaded and can be done in background.
* reactjs is components based

Components: 
* component acts like function in reactjs.
* components are independent and reusable bits of code
* they come in two: functional component and class component

functional component:
* function component is declared using function keyword
* it return HTML
* function FuncName(){
	return(<HTMLdata>);
}

class component:
* class component is declared using class keyword and it extends React.Component
* it returns HTML and compulsory it calls render() method for returning
* class ClassName extends React.Component{
	render(){
	  return(<Html data>);
	}
}

render():
* render() method work like display function
* it displays specific html code inside the html elements
* it can read props and state and return jsx code to the root component of our app but it cannot change the values of props and state

props:
* props stands for properties
* they are used as arguments passed into reactjs compponents

states:

---------------------------------------------------------------

* App component runs the main page of the application
* app() is a functional component where we can write logic of the web page
* react should be imported in very component: import React from "react";

**How to create component and import in App Component--
inside a component:
import React from "react"
function Componentname(){
return();
}
export default componentname;

and import it app component

inside App component:
import Componentname from '<ComponentAddress>';

function App(){
   return(
     <HTML data>
   );
}


----------------------------------------------------------------
npm start

<hr/> - it is a horizontal line
<div style={{background:"yellow", padding:20}} - create object(div) inside an object(style)
